So would we all be on the same page if I said cops are dealing with a mess that begins with civilian racism by a fearful and defensive majority? 

Employers, college admissions boards, real estate plans, random citizens deciding who they do business with, community vibes, wars on drugs, gentrification, etc . . . all this cultural and economic prejudice divides black people, pushing most black people into poorer zip codes with higher crime rates, and pulling black leaders, teachers, academics, and entrepreneurs into richer zip codes. Since cops don't patrol by zip code, nor do they receive economic training about psychological, cultural, or market forces, they don't see the domino effect, they only notice the end result: that black neighborhoods have higher crime rates. This explains why not only are black people at greater risk of being mistreated by white cops, but also by black cops and by other black civilians. 

So a cop's disproportional treatment of races can only be solved if 1) we all wage a proper war on poverty (since everyone loves a good war), 2) cops are provided socio-economic training (since they've currently just got high school diplomas + 6 months of cop school), and 3) black neighborhoods are reimbursed via economic stimulus package for the damages done them by white supremacy over the last 400 years. 

I ask whether this stuff actually makes sense to both sides because I just returned from a Texas State Green Party convention, and everyone there felt that countering racism required that we counter poverty, but most everyone there was white. I would really appreciate if a few folks within the black community could look over our views on race and tell me if we're just a bunch of naive white liberals.
